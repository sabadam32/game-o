This is an interest project to learn programming with the arcade library.  My goal is to build a game toolset that is educational for entry level users.  
Learning Godot, Unity, or even PyGame for a firt attempt can be overwhelming.  I see this helping game jammers or teachers in classroom settings.  Also places like CoderDojo's would be a good spot for this type of thing.


## Installation

Clone the repo

```zsh
# Start in parent directory you want to use for this project then run
git clone git@github.com:sabadam32/game-o.git
cd game-0
```

Now follow the installation instructions for the [arcade library](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/install/index.html) and it's dependencies on your system.

## Usage example
```zsh
python game_o.py
```
